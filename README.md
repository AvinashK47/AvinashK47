# Hi there, I'm Avinash 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate backend developer currently learning and building projects with modern web technologies. I have a strong fascination with technology, which led me to explore the depths of Linux, web development, and containerization.

### 👨‍💻 What I'm Learning:

- **Backend Development**: I’m diving deep into the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), focusing on creating secure, scalable applications.
- **Linux Power User**: I’m an experienced user of **Arch Linux** (with **KDE** as my desktop environment), and I experiment with various window managers like **i3** and **AwesomeWM**. I’ve even compiled and customized my own kernel using **Gentoo Linux**. 
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: I’m learning **Docker** and **Kubernetes** to manage and deploy backend services efficiently.
- **Languages**: Python 🐍, Java ☕, Rust 🦀, JavaScript 💻
